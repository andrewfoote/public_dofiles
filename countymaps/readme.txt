This dropbox folder includes 4 files.

1. county_maps_creation.do

This do-file uses county.dta and countyCOOR.dta to make a map.
Users must set locals at the beginning of the do-file, and everything else
should run by itself.

2. county.dta and 3. countyCOOR.dta

No need to open these files - they enable you to draw a map using SPMAP

4. test_mig_map.dta

This is a sample dataset to see how the do-file works, which includes IRS
SOI data on migration inflows into all counties in 2009. It is provided so that
users can understand how the do-file works.
