# README file for state mapping files

## Program files

1. state_maps_creation.do

This do-file uses state_map.dta and statecoor.dta to make a map.
Users must set locals at the beginning of the do-file, and everything else
should run by itself.

## Input files

2. state_map.dta and 3. statecoor.dta

No need to open these files - they enable you to draw a map using SPMAP

4. test_mig_map_st.dta

This is a sample dataset to see how the do-file works, which includes IRS
SOI data on average county migration inflows for all states in 2009. 
It is provided so that users can understand how the do-file works.
